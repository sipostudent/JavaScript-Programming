// Create a variable to store the city
let city = 'Birmingham'
let city2 = 'Helsinki'

// Create a variable to store the County
let county = 'West Midlands'
let county2 = 'Helsinki County'

// Create a variable to combine the city and county
let location = city + ', ' + county
let location2 = city2 + ', ' + county2

console.log(location)
console.log(location2)
